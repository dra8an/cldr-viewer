# Archive - Initial XML Viewer Implementation

**Date Archived**: December 31, 2024

## Overview

This directory contains documentation from the initial generic XML Viewer implementation (Phases 1-8), which was completed before transforming the project into a specialized CLDR Viewer and Editor.

## Archived Documents

### Implementation Plan
- **Implementation-Plan.md** - Original implementation plan for generic XML viewer

### Phase Documentation (Initial Build)
- **Phase-1-Setup.md** - Project setup (Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- **Phase-2-Types-Utils.md** - Type definitions and utility functions
- **Phase-3-State-Management.md** - XML Context and state management
- **Phase-4-Core-Components.md** - File uploader and core components
- **Phase-5-Tree-View.md** - Tree view implementation with virtualization
- **Phase-6-Detail-View.md** - Detail panel for node inspection
- **Phase-7-App-Integration.md** - Main app integration
- **Phase-8-Polish.md** - UI polish and refinements

## Current Documentation

The current active implementation plan is:
- **CLDR-VIEWER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** (in parent directory)

Current phase documentation uses uppercase "PHASE-*" naming:
- **PHASE-1-COMPLETE.md** - CLDR Data Integration
- **PHASE-2-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md** - CLDR UI Enhancements
- **PHASE-2-3-COMPLETE.md** - Detail Panel Enhancements
- **PHASE-3-1-EDIT-MODE-TOGGLE.md** - Edit Mode Toggle
- More to come as development continues...

## Why Archived?

These documents represent the successful completion of the foundation XML viewer. They were archived to:
1. Avoid confusion between the initial build phases and CLDR-specific phases
2. Maintain historical record of the project's evolution
3. Keep the main Docs directory focused on current CLDR implementation
4. Use consistent naming convention (PHASE-*) for CLDR-specific work

## Relation to Current Work

The generic XML viewer built in these phases serves as the foundation for the CLDR Viewer and Editor. All the core functionality (XML parsing, tree view, detail panel, state management) from these initial phases remains in use and has been enhanced with CLDR-specific features.

**Status**: Successfully completed - December 28-29, 2024
**Next Phase**: CLDR-specific enhancements (Phase 2+)
